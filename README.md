# But what if i don't know how to add cards :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add the your own card because everyone loves Pokémon and everyone should get a chance to add their favourite Pokémons!

Code - 

                <div class="col-lg-4 mb-4">
                    <div class="card">
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="[Link to Slug image]" alt="">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <h5 class="card-title">[Name of your Slug]</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">[Small Description about your Slug]</p>
                            <a href="[Add the link to your Github Profile]" class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-sm">Contributed by - [Add your Github Username/profile name]</a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
