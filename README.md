# SlugTerra

There's no doubt that most  of our childhood was spent watching SlugTerra mostly on DisneyXD, we have seen it all and experienced it all. With Hacktoberfest 2020 coming up and being one of the people who would participate for the very first time, I decided to create this repository that's actually a very basic web-page that lets the user view and add their favourite pokemons. Show your love for slug terra here .

You can find all types Slugs on  https://slugterra.fandom.com/wiki/Slugs  and also on https://www.pinterest.ca/XyroXD/slugterra-slugs-and-stuff/

# But what if I don't know how to add cards :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add your own card because everyone loves Pokémon and everyone should get a chance to add their favourite Pokémons!

Code - 
                <div class="col-lg-4 mb-4">
                    <div class="card shadow">
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="[Link to Slug image]" alt="Bulbasaur" />
                        <div class="card-body mb-3">
                            <h5 class="card-title">[Name of your Slug]</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">[Small Description about your Slug]</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="card-footer text-center">
                            <a href="[Add the link to your Github Profile]" class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-sm">
                                Contributed by - [Add your Github Username/profile name]
                            </a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
