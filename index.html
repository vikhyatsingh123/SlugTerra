His tail (back) has the same properties as his gloves. He has a tooth that sticks out of his mouth when in protoform but not in velocity. The main colour scheme is red, yellow and orange. When he transforms he can easily run on four hands. He would probably not be best to play hot potato with though due to his body heat.</p>

                The Flaringo slug is an extremely common slug that a lot of slingers use. Despite being common, even a Flaringo with little or no experience can cause moderate damage. Firing a Flaringo is a good way to hit a single target with moves like Blastburst and Heatsave, and an OK way to hit more targets with Sparkomet. A Flaringo's major weakness is a water slug, but Frostcrawlers can also be a good way to beat a Flaringo.

                short, stubby arms. They have big brown eyes, with yellow
                lightning bolts above them in an eyebrow scheme. They have
                what seems to be three teeth, two big teeth on the sides on
                the top, and a big tooth under and can fit in between the

              <p class="card-text">Bubbaleones are rare water slugs that are typically found in rocky streams and
                freshwater rivers. When in protoform, it resembles a Lavalynx.
                It transforms into a large bubble-like version of itself as they reach 100 mph.
                They are also capable of protoform bubble blowing, as demonstrated in "The Gentleman and the Thief."
                Against a gattler, a Bubbaleone can be helpful. The indestructible slug skin makes it ideal for
                combating mimics or explosive slugs.
                Bubbaleones can be employed for both surface- and subsurface-based transportation.</p>

                The Fire Elemental Slug is a quite shy but kind of angry slug.
                He has one cream coloured horn on his forehead and gloves that
                let him hold fire. His tail (back) has the same properties as
                his gloves. He has a tooth that sticks out of his mouth when
                in protoform but not in velocity. The main colour scheme is
                red, yellow and orange. When he transforms he can easily run
                on four hands. He would probably not be best to play hot
                potato with though due to his body heat.

                Formerly at velocity, in the design all that could be seen was
                a winged beast with only a head and horns showing, similar to
                the Infurnus. In its protoform, it had horns instead of
                antennae and was almost purely black. The new protoform is
                maroon, with a dirty pink underbelly and a flame-shaped mark
                on its head. It also has two small spikes on it's tail. At
                velocity, the Pyringo retains its colour scheme, but has green
                fire instead of the regular orange of an Flaringo.

                in protoform. It also has two slits on each side of its head
                like gills. At 100 mph they are a brown shark with black lines
                all over it, and also have two sets of fins.

                    In Protoform, Gazzers are similar in shape to Armashelt
                    and Crystalyd Slugs. Their skin and antennae are an ashy
                    brown while their armor and eyes are primarily orange,
                    though their armor has yellow outlines. When transformed,
                    they take on a shape that almost seems like a chestnut.
                    While their colors stay the same, they form four large
                    holes in their shell that emits different types of gasses
                    (depending on the attack). The gasses tend to appear as
                    different shades of brown and yellow (also depending on
                    the attack). They have an underbite that shows uneven
                    teeth.
